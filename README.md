# Pickems Center

Welcome to the Pickems Center repository! This project is a web-based platform where users can compete with each other by predicting the final standings for the Soccer Euro 2024 group stage.

- Point system that rewards accuracy in predicting group standings.
- Leaderboard page to track users' rankings and standings.
- Interactive and engaging game play experience.
